"Intensive Management Trail"~"Welcome to the Intensive Management Trail"~"Welcome to Intensive Management Trail, a hiker-only trail located within Oregon State University's College Forests! This 1.2 mile trail was built to allow forest visitors an increase biodiversity. These QR codes accompany the interpretive signs that you will encounter along the trail. You will pass through at least 13 different managed plots and encounter examples of pruning, thinning, different spacing options, and the sustainable practice of agroforestry, which combines agricultural practices and forestry."~"The forest stands you will encounter were planted in the 1960s and 1970s with seedlings of Douglas-fir (<italic>Pseudotsuga menziesii </italic>) from around the Pacific Northwest with the intent of watching how each different strain would grow in this area different forest practices on the growth and health of the stands. After 30 to 40 years of growth, effects of some of those practices are now apparent. Look for numbered posts along the way that correlate to the following stops so you can learn about the different areas as you go."~"welcometotheintensivemanagementtrail;intensivemapwelcome;stop1valleyponderosa"
"Intensive Management Trail"~"Stop #1: Valley Ponderosa"~"This stand of Valley ponderosa pine was planted in 1994 in the memory of Doug Tinstadt who identified this strain of ponderosa pine as one that historically covered the Willamette Valley."~"Unlike the ponderosa pine native to eastern Oregon, this strain can thrive in the Valley's wet winters and dry summers. For more information, check out the website of the Willamette Valley Ponderosa Pine Conservation Association, whose major goals are conservation and re-establishment of ponderosa pine in the Willamette Valley."~"welcometotheintensivemanagementtrail;stop1valleyponderosa"
"Intensive Management Trail"~"Stop #2: Close Spacing for Quality"~"To observe the relationship between spacing and wood quality, this stand of Douglas-fir was planted in 1972 with 8 ft. by 8 ft. spacing, then was randomly thinned in the early 1990s. "~"Douglas-fir requires abundant sunlight to grow well, so the close spacing restricted the sunlight reaching the trunks. As a result, the lower limbs died and fell off.  Having fewer limbs on the 'boles,' or trunks, of the trees produces higher quality lumber with fewer knots, a feature that is important in construction situations where the grain of the wood is exposed.  "~"welcometotheintensivemanagementtrail"
"Intensive Management Trail"~"Stop #3: Wide Spacing for Growth"~"These trees were planted in 1969 with 12 ft. by 12 ft. spacing. Due to reduced competition from other trees, these trees grew faster than the previous stand. "~"The increased light coming through the canopy also allowed the limbs to remain viable and grow lower on the trunks. Although this wider spacing leads to faster tree growth, it produces lower quality lumber than in the previous stand, with more and bigger knots."~"welcometotheintensivemanagementtrail"
"Intensive Management Trail"~"Stop #4: Hybrid Pines"~"Here we have a stand of KMX hybrid pine trees, which is a cross between knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata) and Monterey pine (Pinus radiata). The cross was created to take advantage of the tall, straight, and clear growth habit of the Monterey pine, which is not cold hardy, as well as the cold hardiness of the knobcone pine, which is a native to eastern Oregon. "~"Although the cross was fairly successful, KMX is highly prone to diseases and very seldom grows to its full potential here in Oregon. This is a good example of the advantage of planting native species, like Douglas-fir or ponderosa pine, which are acclimated to Oregon climates and environments. Non-native species plantings can be risky for forest managers due to their higher risk of failure."~"welcometotheintensivemanagementtrail"
"Intensive Management Trail"~"Stop #5: Thinning vs. No Thinning"~"This area demonstrates the difference between thinning and not thinning. Although this may look like two different stands, they were actually planted at the same time in 1972. The trees on the left were thinned in 1990 to promote faster tree growth, while the trees on the right were not thinned."~" Thinning also affected ground vegetation. Increased sunlight in the thinned area allowed the vegetation to grow, whereas in the un-thinned area, the lack of sunlight and competition for nutrients and water resulted in restricted growth."~"welcometotheintensivemanagementtrail"
"Intensive Management Trail"~"Stop #6: Pruning"~"Producing high quality, knot-free lumber increases its commercial value and as a result, forest managers work hard and try several methods to achieve this result. This stand was planted in 1970 and then pruned in 1992 to eliminate the lower limbs, thus reducing the number and size of knots. "~"Although this technique yielded good results, it is labor intensive and is therefore seldom used."~"welcometotheintensivemanagementtrail"
"Intensive Management Trail"~"Stop #7: Silviculture and Agroforestry"~"This stand is an example of diverse silvicultural (forest vegetation management) practices. One practice is agroforestry, the practice of combining agriculture and forestry by growing crops or grasses beneath the trees, as well as grazing livestock. This practice creates a forest that is diverse, productive, healthy, and sustainable for multiple outputs. "~"To observe the effect of planting in clusters versus a regular single-tree grid on forage production and tree growth, Douglas-firs were planted in 1979 in clusters of three, spaced at 25 ft. This spacing allowed the growth of grasses and vegetation underneath the clus-ters to be used as forage. Between 1983 and 1988, sheep were grazed on one side of the trail and not the other. You can still see the effects on the side that was grazed compared to the one that was not! Trees on the south side of each group were later thinned to increase tree growth. In 1988, red alder (Alnus rubra) was planted between the clusters because alder produces a usable form of soil nitrogen. Cluster planting of conifers along with the alder planting may also benefit wildlife by providing better diversity of food and shelter."~"welcometotheintensivemanagementtrail"
"Intensive Management Trail"~"Stop #8: Disatrous Competition"~"This stand was created to show the effects of what will occur in a dense and unmanaged forest. Planted in 1964, this is the oldest stand of Douglas-fir along this trail. However, the trees are neither the biggest nor the healthiest. Trees were planted with irregular spacing averaging 4 ft. by 4 ft., but were never thinned. The increased density caused intense competition between trees resulting in slow growth, a loss of vigor, and increased mortality as the stand tried to naturally thin itself, a process that foresters call competitive exclusion. "~"Competitive exclusion can become a disaster. An accumulation of dead fuels, if ignited, can cause very hot, intense, and destructive forest fires. When bugs or diseases enter the stand, the entire stand can be killed. This is why thinning is an important step in maintaining a healthy forest."~"welcometotheintensivemanagementtrail"
"Intensive Management Trail"~"Stop #9: End of the Trail"~"This completes your self-guided tour of Intensive Management trail. The stand you are now in was a study of about 175 different seed sources coming from different elevations throughout the northwest. This is an example of just one of the many forest management studies found along this trail."~" We hope you have enjoyed learning about some of the many techniques that have been tried here, as well as some of the issues surrounding forest management. OSU College Forests would like to thank you for participating in this interpretive trail, please stop by again soon!"~"welcometotheintensivemanagementtrail"
